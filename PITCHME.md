##### <!--fit--> A Kubernetes native framework

---

### Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯

* Microservice focused
* Containers not servers
* Creating and killing nodes all the time
* Scale out, not up

---
### How does it support this?

* Fast start up
* Low memory usage
* GraalVM Secret Sauce

---

### Tools we all know and love(ish)
* Dependency Injection
* JAX-RS (or Spring Web API)
* Vert.x (reactive API)
* JPA, Hibernate
* Etc.....

##### <!--fit--> Code!

### Native Images

* Native binary (Linux 64 bit)
* Ahead of time compiled
* Statically linked
* Class initialisation at build time (Profiles for different environments)
* Ridiculous start up time
* Ridiculously low memory usage

---

##### <!--fit--> Demo!

Which opens the door to...

---

### Java on Lambda ðŸ˜²

* Lambda API abstracted away - no events, etc
* Routing all done by the framework 

---

##### <!--fit--> Another Demo!

---
### Drawbacks :(

* Native images slow to create
* JVM tests fast but not the same as native
* Some libraries not compatible with AOT compilation
* `@RegisterForReflection` due to dead code removal
* SSL fiddly
